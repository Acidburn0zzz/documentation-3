## The Google Reader Compatible API

When Google announced it was shutting down Google Reader, we [stepped in and announced](http://blog.superfeedr.com/google-reader-compatible-api/) that we would be offering a replacement for its widely used API.

This API will (at least for now) be *limited to entry and feed data* and excludes the user state sync. As such features such as starred items, shared items, or anything related to a user or its action is excluded.

We also announced that we will **back up as much feed data** as possible from Google Reader's API until July 1st.

If you want to start working with this API, please [start here](./blob/master/google-reader-api/README.md).

## Support and Questions

For any question, you may either email us directly (superfeedr@superfeedr.com) or use the [Issues Section](/superfeedr/documentation/issues). We will try to respond as quickly as possible on either channel.

## Contribution
