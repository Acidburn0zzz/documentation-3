	<h2>Superfeedr Documentation</h2>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p><a href="http://superfeedr.com/">Superfeedr</a> provides a realtime API to any application who wants to produce (publishers) or consume (subscribers) data feeds without wasting resources and maintaining an expensive and changing infrastructure.</p>
	<p>This documentation shows how to integrate Superfeedr into a variety of diverse infrastructure, as well as highlights most of the features offered by Superfeedr.</p>
	<p>It is expected that the reader has a strong knowledge of the web&#39;s main protocols, as well as its design constraints. As we believe the web is a better ecosystem when <strong>open protocols</strong> are favored over proprietary APIs, we have decided to build on <em>existing protocols and implementations</em>. This means that there exists several libraries and modules, which, even though they have not been built with Superfeedr in mind could (and should!) be used to interract with our endpoints. We also strongly encourage that you inspect these protocols and the data formats to extract the biggest value out of them.</p>
